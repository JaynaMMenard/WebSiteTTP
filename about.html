                <h1 class="l-heading"><span class="text-primary">About</span> Flint Water Crisis</h1>
                <p>  The Flint water crisis is a public health crisis that started in 2014, after the drinking water source for the city of Flint, Michigan was changed
                     In April 2014, Flint changed its water source from treated Detroit Water and Sewerage Department water (sourced from Lake Huron and the Detroit River) to the Flint River.
                     Officials failed to apply corrosion inhibitors to the water. As a result, lead from aging pipes leached into the water supply, 
                     leading to extremely elevated levels of the heavy metal neurotoxin and exposing over 100,000 residents to elevated lead levels.
                     A pair of scientific studies proved that lead contamination was present in the water supply.
                     Flint and state officials have been talking for months about how to handle Lead and Copper Rule testing as fewer and 
                     fewer homes in the city are left with lead service lines.
                     Using contractors funded by the state and federal government in response to the Flint water crisis, 
                     most but not all lead service lines in the city have been replaced during the last three years.

                <h1 class="l-heading"><span class="text-primary">What's</span> Our Plan</h1>
                <p>A change in water supply funnelling from lake huron to the flint river has left the city in a water crisis that has affected thousands of residents.
                   For two years, a threat has been imposed upon residents and is now in the forefront of the nation’s attention. Unhealthy drinking water has plagued 
                   the community by disrupting the health and livelihood of thousands of people. While some claim corruption, others just demand a call to action, 
                   righting the wrongs that have disrupted the lives of many.  An estimated $1.5 billion is the cost of repair for the city’s damaged distribution system.
                   This is our cause and the only way to help progress Flint Michigan's restoration, we must donate.
